Prison Riot is a bullet hell simulator game that was written in Java using the Greenfoot framework.
Prison Riot uses the WASD keys for movement and Left-Click to interact with the game as well as make attacks in the direction of the mouse cursor.

It is recommended to download Greenfoot and the project source code in order to run the program.
It can also be played from the Greenfoot website from my profile, however there may be issues with HTML5 translation.
